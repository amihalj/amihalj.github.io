    Hi!

    I am Ante Mihalj, software engineer with 15 year experience in various technologies. I value hard work, team spirit and search for knowledge. I have made a full circle from "Hello worlds", implementing banking core systems, playing lead dev roles in few startups (both back and front end) to client consultancy and team education. 
  
personal:
  title: Short history
  content: >-
    I have started with software development during my colledge, working with Java and .NET desktop frameworks. After graduation my interrest kept growing and I decided to persue development as my main profession. Learning new programming languages and self-improvement were my daily basis.

    I have spend few years in banking IT industry, learning enterprise level skills and technologies - IBM, Java enterprise, Websphere etc. I have spend some time building bank core system and integration to existing co-system.

    I have had few startup projects behind me, worked on them as lead dev or a consultant. Most of them were __Microsoft technology__ based, built as API, WebForm and SPA. One of them really succeeded ,you may see what it is about [Repsly](www.repsly.com)

    After that I spent few years doing consultancy and development for __Salesforce.com__ development based company in UK. Salesforce.com is the biggest cloud based CRM platform and client company delivers packages and products built on that platform. Beside consulting on Salesforce I have worked days and nights with a dev team to delived cloud based e-commerce API system hosted on __Heroku__ that integrates with Salesforce and suports scalability that Salesforce build-in limitations prevent.

    Currently I am working with a partner company [Zeraxo](www.zeraxo.com) as a Principal technical consultant, leading and educating a team of developers or working as a software architect / consultant on projects. We provide various development services and you can contact us if you need a __team of highly qualified software engineers__

history:
  title: History
  content: >-  
    I started with development during my colledge making desktop apps in .NET and Java. After my studies and few projects I decided to work in banking industries to craft enterprise development skills where I worked with technologies like **JavaEE, Beans, IBM websphere**. 
    
    
    After few years I decided it's time to try something more dynamic and I joined one promising startup where I worked as a full stack lead developer with **Microsoft technologies (.NET, SQL server)** and open source (Apache, HTML+CSS, jQuery ...). Target was world wide, the bar was high and so were our hopes.
    
    
    When starup has launced, passed critical time and became sucessfull product I decided it's time to try something else. I joined one agency that was specified in satellite industry software and spend a year working on their products. This is where I heavily worked in frontend **SPA technologies (Angular, HTML5) and NodeJS with MongoDb** 

    Since my startup experience was involved with **CRM** I was offered to do consultancies for a client working on  **Salesforce.com platform** - world's leading CRM cloud platform. Also client wanted to integrate platform with Heroku Paas and offer e-commerce cloud Saas where a team of experts worked on implementation.
